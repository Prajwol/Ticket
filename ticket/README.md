Project Introduction
We as a team of four are designing a web system for our Customer, which can be
used by the Customer’s customer to submit any complaints/queries which they
have when using the cloud services provided by our Customer. The customer will
fill up forms with their details and their issues, and submit the form to the admin.
Each form submitted will be considered as ticket which the admin will have access
to. The below table gives a brief introduction to our project
